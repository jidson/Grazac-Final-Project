Final Project at Grazac Academy

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this analysis was to highlight the main factors driving customer churn and identify key geographic areas with the highest churn rates, enabling targeted retention strategies.


OBSERVATION AND KEY INSIGHTS
The total customer base is 7,043, with a nearly even distribution between female (3,488) and male (3,555) customers.
The average customer tenure is approximately 32.39 months, indicating a relatively stable customer base.
Total refunds issued are $13.82K, which is relatively low compared to the revenue and charges, indicating good service satisfaction or efficient refund policies.
There is a balanced number of single/unmarried (3.6K) and married (3.4K) customers.
Male customers have made slightly more referrals (3.56K) compared to female customers (3.49K).
The largest customer age group is the "Old" category, with 2,513 customers. Middle-aged (1,422) and adult (1,390) customers follow, while the "Very Old" (939) and "Young Adults" (779) groups have the smallest customer counts. This suggests that the service might be more popular among older demographics.
A larger number of customers prefer paperless billing (4,171) compared to those who prefer paper billing (2,872). This indicates a trend towards digital solutions.
A significant majority of customers (78.3%) have internet service, with 5,517 customers using it, while 21.7% (1,526 customers) do not have internet service.
The vast majority of customers (90.32%) have phone service (6,361 customers), while only a small fraction (9.68%) do not (682 customers).
Fiber optic is the most purchased internet service with 3,035 customers. Other internet services include DSL (1,652 customers), cable (830 customers), and a notable portion of customers with no internet service (1,526).
The "Normal Service" is overwhelmingly the most accepted offer, with 3,877 customers. Other offers have significantly fewer acceptances, with Offer B (824), Offer E (805), Offer D (602), Offer A (520), and Offer C (415) being less popular.
